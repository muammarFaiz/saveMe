    <h1>The Best Movies According to Faiz</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>The Lord of The Rings trilogy</h3>
    <p>okay, immediately the first movie that crossed my mind would be The Lord of The Rings trilogy. there is nothing like it that is close to its quality and massiveness.</p>
    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>for a movie about the space it definitely capture its vastness and some of its beauty and wonder. no movie ever done that to the level of Interstellar.</p>
    <h3>Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
    <p>this movie have the highest anticipation and hype that i ever remember. years of building up the hype, massive budget, and access to
        the most advanced tech in modern movie making. i think this movie have everyhting needed to be the highest grossing movie of its time.</p>
